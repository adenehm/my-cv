# Writing Samples

In my four years as a Technical Writer at Scaleway, I have had the opportunity to write documentation for different products,  work on several types of documentation, and produce instructional video content. You can find examples of content I worked on below.

## Website

During my apprenticeship at Scaleway, I documented processes to accelerate learning and become autonomous. Later, I used those notes to mentor a new apprentice on API documentation and [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), a tool I had learned to use during a workshop I had scheduled with a Product Manager.

This initiative eventually led me to develop an [onboarding website](https://onboarding-docteam-bucket.s3-website.fr-par.scw.cloud/) for new documentation team members.

## User Interface Documentation

Documentation of Scaleway products, i.e. how to use and manage them in the graphic interface: the Scaleway console. Different content types, such as concepts, how-tos, reference content, and API/CLI tutorials are available to help users understand and use the products.

As a Technical Writer at Scaleway, I am not responsible for creating videos, but when the company had fewer products, I volunteered to produce short clips for the marketing website to show users how quick and easy it is to get started with Scaleway products.

### Mini videos
